# Another minimal GBA

This [delta](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688) / [manic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manic-emu-game-emulator/id6743335790) theme aims to:

- Maximize the screen size on iPhone landscape edge-to-edge
- Be as light as posible (all the elements are vetorized)
- Position the buttons for a more ergonomic handle
- Keep the game as the main subject
- Look minimal

Future updates:

- Adapt the theme to various consoles that work best horizontally (PSP, SNES, NES...)
