# Another minimal GBA

This [delta](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688) theme aims to:

- Maximize the screen size on iPhone landscape edge-to-edge
- Be as light as posible (all the elements are vetorized)
- Position the buttons for a more ergonomic handle
- Keep the game as the main subject
- Look minimal

## Config

Download the last version on the archive folder; Import on the iOS app; set the oppacity to whatever you wish; play your fav game.
